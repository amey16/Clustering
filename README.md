# Clustering
k-means and hierarchical clustering with image segmentation and dominant color extraction

# Datasets required 
Dataset and the image are randomly picked from the web to get them either download then from the repo <br/>
or clone the repository using the command
```
git clone https://github.com/amey16/Clustering.git
```

How to download opencv module -
``` pip install opencv-python ```
